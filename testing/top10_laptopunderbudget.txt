Feb 21, 2019 by Mike Johnson in Best of Best

Looking for a laptop which can replace your high-end desktop? Then you need to look at nowhere than the best intel i7 processor laptops because laptops powered by an intel i7 processor are the most powerful laptops among all other intel processor laptops and therefore they are the most suitable portable machines for power demanding tasks like gaming, video and film editing, music production, CAD, etc. Well, if you go one step down, then Intel i5 processor laptops are still great affordable performers. So, do you really need an i7 laptop? Which are the best core i7 laptops available to buy? Let’s find it out…

Intel is a giant in manufacturing computer hardware, and when it comes to processors, Intel has their flagship processor in the form of ‘Intel Core i9 processor’, and it is the best gaming and creation laptop processor Intel has ever built, but it is not for everyone. It offers 6 cores and has 12 threads with a clock frequency of up to 4.8 GHz which will be overkill for average users like you and me. Intel Core i9 CPU is best suited to power users like videographers who have to edit high-resolution videos or engineers for 3D designing. For normal users who want to multitask or play the newest games at respectable frame rates and edit photos and videos, Intel Core i7 processor is still the best option .

Intel Core i7 processor is powering millions (if not billions) of PCs and laptops around the world. And, if we talk about the ‘laptops’ specifically, then Intel i7 processor laptops is still known for their desktop-class performance and power saving capabilities. However, the performance of every core i7 laptop differs with the different model of the Intel i7 processor installed in the laptop.

So next question that might be hitting your mind right now is;

Which Intel i7 Processor Model Laptop is Perfect For You?

To decide this, you need to check and understand the specifications of each Intel i7 processor model. Let me help you with that as well…

Below is the table which has specifications of each and every mobile (laptop) Intel i7 processor models…

Mobile Intel i7 Coffee Lake Processors Comparison (Data were taken from intel.com )

As you can see, there are number of i7 processors for laptops based on the cache memory, clock frequency, integrated graphics and number of cores and threads. To buy the best i7 laptop for yourself, you have to consider all these specifications and then decide which i7 processor model laptop is perfect for your work.
Expert’s Tip –
If you want the laptop for heavy multitasking and occasional gaming, then buy quad-core (U-Series) i7 processor laptop with 8MB cache memory. It will output enough thrust of power for your everyday works and also save you few bucks to buy a nice backpack for your new laptop .
If you are looking for a high-end laptop for gaming or doing other intensive tasks, then go with the hexacore (H-Series) i7 processor laptop with 9MB or more than 9MB of cache memory. It will be able to run all the latest games without any lag and also do 4K (and 8K!) video rendering.

So now you might have decided, with which Intel core i7 processor model you will go for your new laptop…

But wait..!

Have you checked laptops powered by i5 processors? Because i5 processor laptops are great affordable all-around performers and some of them even outperform laptops powered by Intel i7 processor. Yes, that’s true! The 8th Gen (H-Series) quad-core i5 processor laptops are powerful than (U-Series) quad-core i7 processor laptops and they are cheaper too! 

So there’s again confusion –

Whether you should buy Intel i5 Processor Laptop or Intel i7 Processor Laptop?

The easiest way to decide this is, by keeping benchmark scores of both CPUs side by side and check which processor wins in it. Here you go…
Cinebench R15 Multi-Core CPU Score

Cinebench R15 is a benchmark test performed to check the performance of CPU and GPU. It will give an idea about the real-life performance of CPU when used for movie editing or animation. Checkout score of Intel Core i5-8300H and Intel Core i7-8550U in the below-given image.

Intel Processors 3DMark Score

3D Mark of CPU score is used to analyze the performance of processors and graphics card to check gaming capabilities of any computer setup or laptop. This will give you the idea on gaming performance of Intel Core i5 and i7 Processors. Check out below given image (higher is better).

X264 HD Benchmark Test of Intel Processors Score

X264 HD is a benchmark test that measures how fast a CPU can transcode 1080p video clip into an x264 file. If you are going to do a lot of high definition video rendering on your i7 laptop, then this score will show you the comparison of it with Intel Core i5 processors.

As you can see that in all the benchmark tests, Intel Core i7-8550U loses against Intel Core i5-8300H, that’s because i5-8300H has higher base clock frequency than the i7-8550U. So, for performance-oriented works, the quad-core i5 is a lot better than the quad-core i7 powered laptop.

So definitely, it is better to buy a laptop with the H-Series (i5-8300H & i5-8400H) quad-core i5 processor rather than buying the laptop with U-Series (i7-8550U & i7-8650U) quad-core i7 processor but there’s also one benefit of buying an Intel i7 processor laptop over i5 processor laptop, and that is battery efficiency . Intel i7 processor is more energy efficient than Intel i5 processor so battery backup of i7 quad core laptops will be much higher than quad-core i5 processor laptops.
Don't forget,
Quad core (H-Series) i5 laptops are powerful than quad-core (U-Series) i7 laptops but Intel i7 hexa-core laptops are real badass, and its performance is far higher than i5 processor laptops.

Now, it’s your choice. You can either buy the laptop with H-series quad-core i5 processor which will give better performance or buy the laptop with U-series quad-core i7 processor to have more battery backup from your laptop. If you have changed your mind and planning to buy the i5 processor laptop, then check out our guide to buy best Intel core i5 processor laptops . Well, if you are a hard-core user and planning to buy the best intel Core i7 processor laptop for yourself then check out our recommended best i7 laptop deals below with the detailed reviews of each by our laptop experts.

Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop

While the previous gen Acer Predator Helios 300 is still one of our top choices in $1000 price range, the recently launched Acer Predator Helios 300 is our most favorite among all the i7 powered laptops right now. It provides exceptional value and comes with the 144Hz 15-inch full HD IPS display , latest 8th generation Intel core i7 hexa-core processor and has 16GB of RAM. This laptop also has the newest Pascal based Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB DDR5 graphics card which effortlessly handles gaming on this laptop. For storage, this laptop offers 256GB of SSD which we think is sufficient for normal users but if you need more space then it does have an empty storage drive bay inside to insert HDD or SSD.

Why did you not mention the 8650u or 8550u? My 8550u laptop scored 812 in cinebench r15.

Hi John,
We agree that i7-8550U and i7-8650U are very able processors and we do have laptops with those CPUs included in the list but we are waiting for the launch of other 8th Gen Intel CPUs to update the above mentioned CPU comparison charts. Never mind!
